#  Cryptography #

## Overview ##

This is my submission to this year's Swift Student Challenge. It is all about Cryptography and intended to give you an overview over how we can use it in Swift (i.e., what frameworks we're being offered, how we can use them, ...). Further, I implement an end-to-end-encrypted chat application as an example to using the Swift `Crypto` framework.
